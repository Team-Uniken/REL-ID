# REL-ID
#### The Next Generation Identity & Authentication SDK

======
**REL-ID** is a suite of product offerings built on a cutting edge security protocol (**RMAK**) that creates a MITM-proof tunnel between applications.  When combined with client-side device fingerprints, application fingerprints, and standard user credentials, enterprises can extend better-than-VPN-IPsec security from applications inside their premise all the way to the application layer on an end-user's device.  

#### How It Works
Typical identity is analogous to a passport or business card - absolute to the end-point and self-contained in its delivery.  Instead of just exchanging business cards, **REL-ID** focuses on the unique relationship between two parties.  The comparable analogy would be like writing a quick note about a businesss partner on a napkin and ripping it in half.  You then give one half to your partner and keep the other.  The rip and the note create a perfect, 1:1 relationship known only to the two of you, but stealing a half from one of you does not expose the entire credential.  **REL-ID** performs a similar function mathematically. By using the relationship between two endpoints as the identity, not simply the absolute identities at each end, an on-demand network of uniquely encrypted private tunnels can be created across the network between every user/device/application combination.  The resulting **REL-ID Private Network (RPN)** is like an app-to-app VPN that is blazing fast and Internet scale.
